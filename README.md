<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![product-screenshot]](https://github.com/Matt-Jones-Developer/Console-Finances)


I was asked to write a program that could generate a financial report within the console, using vanilla JS.

The output demonstrates that my code met the following criteria:

- [ ] Find the total number of months [DONE]
- [ ] Find the total income for the entire period [DONE]
- [ ] Find the 'average change' (2 parts) [DONE]
    - [ ] Calculate the PnL for each month [DONE]
    - [ ] Find the average change in $ [DONE]
- [ ] Calculate and display the month with the biggest increase in profits [DONE]
- [ ] Calculate and display the month with the biggest loss in profits [DONE]

I found the project (initially) both challenging and confusing, since we were given an alternative set of answers that I thought were the 'correct' ones; in the end my answers matched the ones from the original project brief.  I felt like I had to teach myself JavaScript before I could even write any code.  A lot of what was required was not previously taught, but I get why that was an advantage to improve my problem solving skills and my Google searching skills to seek out and test new syntax and ideas for myself - which really bumped up my game and made me feel pretty confident.

As a complete beginner to JS, I utilized Google a lot, experimented with new ideas and syntax (I must have a draft with over 1000 lines of code, trying to work out how to solve each issue!) - most times I was over-thinking and over complicating them, but I was proud to solve the problems finally, with some cleanly written, fairly concise Javascript!
